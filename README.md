# HRTPP: Interpretable Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes

## Overview
Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes (HRTPP) is a novel framework that integrates temporal logic rules with numerical features to enhance both interpretability and predictive accuracy in event modeling. HRTPP is particularly effective in medical applications, such as disease onset prediction, progression analysis, and clinical decision support.

## Key Features
- **Interpretable Event Modeling**: Combines rule-based mechanisms with numerical feature augmentation for structured and explainable predictions.
- **Three-Component Intensity Function**:
  - **Basic Intensity**: Captures intrinsic event likelihood.
  - **Rule-Based Intensity**: Encodes structured temporal dependencies.
  - **Numerical Feature Intensity**: Dynamically adjusts event probabilities.
- **Efficient Rule Mining**:
  - Two-phase rule mining strategy to balance complexity and accuracy.
  - Bayesian optimization for efficient rule space exploration.
- **Multi-Criteria Evaluation Framework**:
  - Assesses rule validity, model fitting, and temporal predictive accuracy.
  - Case studies validate HRTPPâ€™s ability to explain disease progression.
